o	Problem statement: Stock Analysis report for the Future Options was a tedious and cumbersome process of consolidation of the data 
from various sources like price changes, trade values, total trades, delivery position, no of contracts & change in open interests.
	The time spent on these report and manual errors introduced lot of confusion and not so reliable report so that the experts 
could make use of it for their day to day decision making.
o	Created a python script which would pull up the data into a central place and then use this raw information to provide a 
complete reliable report from which decision on stock trading can be done.
