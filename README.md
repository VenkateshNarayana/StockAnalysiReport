### CONCLUSION

Created a python script which would pull up the data into a central place and then use this raw information to provide a 
complete reliable report from which decision on stock trading can be done.

### FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
Below are few things that can be implemented in near future.

  - Automaticlly run the script file to pull the raw data from the different sources and put it in destination and kickoff the generation of the report only when all the data files have been collated.
